# CMD_BOT

Telegram bot for remote maintenance of a work computer.

# Motivation

There are situations when your remote work computer won't response via RDP after a connection to another network. So, you could reset network or reboot it, but definitely can't do it.
This software may solve this problem (I hope ðŸ˜Š).
